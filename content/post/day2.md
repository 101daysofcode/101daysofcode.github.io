1. Decided if I was going to use the journal blog, why fiddle around with source/master branch and manual pushes into master branch.
1. Configured travis ci [build script](https://github.com/101daysofcode/101daysofcode.github.io/blob/source/.travis.yml) with personal access token and username to publish into master on successful builds.
